<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystalline Fructose for Food Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Starch Hydrolysis</li><li>Sucrose Hydrolysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crystalline fructose is a natural sweetener derived from the hydrolysis of starch or sucrose. In starch hydrolysis, enzymes break down starch into glucose, which is then converted to fructose, producing a high-fructose product. Conversely, sucrose hydrolysis involves splitting sucrose into glucose and fructose, often resulting in a sweeter product. Both processes cater to a growing food market demand for calorie reduction and healthier sweetening options, focusing on enhanced flavor profiles and improved glycemic responses in products.</p></p>
